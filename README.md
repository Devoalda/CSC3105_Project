# CSC 3105 Project

This project involves data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The data is first standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Then, PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining 95% of the original variance.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `Project.ipynb`: This is the main Jupyter notebook file where all the data processing.
- `./UWB-LOS-NLOS-Data-Set/dataset`: This directory contains the dataset used in the project.
